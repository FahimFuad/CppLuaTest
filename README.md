# SpikeProjectSystem
## Templated project intialized with premake and batch files, so that you don't need to think about setting up preamke stuff. This is also initalized with a CI.
 - You just need to run the batch file in the `scripts` folder, which will give you a VS2019 `.sln` file.
 - All the source file goes to the `src` folder.
 - The output directory and the target directory is `bin` and `bin-int` respectively.
 - Edit the `premake5.lua` to fit your needs.
 - The premake5.exe is in `vendor\premake\bin`.
 - Edit this readme if you have generated a project with this template.
